# open-ai

### Summary
Open AI Notebooks with examples on Prompt Engineering, Content Safety APIs, Embedding APIs etc. All examples use AAD auth and use Managed Identity to authenticate against Azure Open AI or authenticate against an Azure Key Vault and retrieves keys from it. So, there is no need to store keys/secrets in code or anywhere in the OS or filestores.
